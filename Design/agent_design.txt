AGENT DESIGN DOCUMENT:
	
off the top ideas:
- will have it's own health that acts like attempts for the run so it lasts a lttle longer
- will have it own controller that controls its velocities in order to move
- will not be doing any jumps as this simulation is in top-down perspective, won't look right
- will observe the environment around them with raycasts that determine these things:
	distance from self to endpoint of raycast
	what is hitting the endpoint of the raycast
- Agents will have a very large raycast, they can "see" from one end of a room to the next, and they do not know
  where the exit location is until their raycasts "sees" it, so they have to learn to find the exit and then pass
  the traps in order to reach it. (will need to find out how to not make agents not like run around in circles and
  to like proceed towards traps because most likely the exit will be somewhere past them)
- agents can be spectated which will make camera focus on them (with some dampening) and showcases their brain, 
  their current velocity, time alive and score

	DETERMINANTS
	the angle of the ray
	vision depth, (short-range, mid-range, long-range) to determine what to do next (unsure if needed)
	
	TIME PERMITTING:
		if implementing moving traps, will calculate the relative velocities between self and object moving
