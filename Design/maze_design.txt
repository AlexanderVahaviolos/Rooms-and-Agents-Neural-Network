MAZE DESIGN DOCUMENT:

off the top features:
- dynamically generated
- 2D
- Room based
- traps to hinder the agent's progress and add variability
- there will be an x amount of room that is either determined by the user beforehand or randomly in a range
- rooms will contain a randomly generated challenge that agents will have to get through to go on to the next room
- rooms may have more than one exit, meaning they branch off into a different room separate from the original path,
  but will always be the same length to the exit to introduce more variability. Will have option to enable branching
  rooms, will make this not customizable (for now idk) as there's quite a few parameters
- will have a movable camera where you can see all of the rooms at once, like you can freely move around the camera
  and scale it out. Also able to spectate individual agents and have camera be tracked on that
