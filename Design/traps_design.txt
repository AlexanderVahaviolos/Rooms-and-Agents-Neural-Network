spikes - injures the agent + applies opposite knockback to agent + minor stun (stop moving) when collided with
arrow trap - activated by pressure plate (which can be seen) that will fire arrows that injure/kill the agent
moving lasers - active on a timer, first moves in a singular direction that sweeps an area then deactivates for
a set amount of time (not entirely certain on the balancing of this)
