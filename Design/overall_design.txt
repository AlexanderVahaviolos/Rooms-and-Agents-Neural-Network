OVERALL DESIGN DOCUMENT:
	
make a reinforcement learning neural network for agents going through a maze that contain traps where they are
graded based on performance and penalized if they do certain unwanted actions during the training process.

(game will be 2D)

CONTAINS:
	MAZE:
	will be a randomly generated discrete maze (might use wave function collapse) that contain traps
	
	AGENTS:
	will be the entities that will navigate and learn how to avoid being penalized and try to obtain
	the greatest performance that are inherited through each generation
